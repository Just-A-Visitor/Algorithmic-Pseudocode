# Review 
* An excellent question to refresh the basics of **BFS** and **STL** containers.
* **Time Taken** : 15 minutes (including brain storming and coding)
* **Penalty** : None
* **What's New?**
  * Found a clean way for searching in an unordered_map/set. 
  * Adopted a new way to populate STL Containers with the help of existing containers.
  * A Novel approach to change a single charcter of a string using range based for loops.
  
  
  # To Do
  * Perform BFS with marker to avoid pushing a pair into the queue.
  * Apply an alternate technique of modifying the dictionary instead of a `visited` hashmap.

### Review
* One of the best questions that I've encountered on DP so far. The DP definition is so tricky, yet when you see it, you cannot   unsee it. Simple, yet elegant. I was skimming throught the top voted solutions, still unable to grasp the logic. Then I         stubled upon [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/discuss/76228/Share-some-analysis-and-explanations/167308)     top voted comment in the top voted solution and things became crystal clear. I implemented the recursive solution using   memoization and it passed in the first try. (Not even a single compilation error, WOW!).


### To Do 
* Explain your approach. Write comments.
* Implement iterative DP

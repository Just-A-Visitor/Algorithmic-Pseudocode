### Review 
* Passed all the test cases in the first submission. However, I think the solution is a bit inefficient as I'm creating the DSU using maps (and not arrays). There are a couple of great (and short) solutions on Discuss. I need to go through them.
* This is an excellent question to practice Graphs and DSUs

### To Do
* Make the code more concise and efficient
* Explain your approach
* Attempt it via Graph (DFS)

**Experience**   
Finally I've got some time to share my experience. Damn, these deadlines are just controlling my life. It's like I'm being carried away with the flow of these deadlines without a personal schedule.

So coming to the point, I got an internship at Samsung Research & Development Institute, Bangalore. I have no idea what the profile is (they did mention student trainee though). I was dumbstruck when I saw the mail regarding the offer letter. I couldn't have been more happy. Here I was sitting for SIP internships, being rejected at the resume shortlisting stage at most of the startups, without a hope of getting an internship this year. Samsung came to to the rescue as the light at the end of the tunnel. So, was it luck? Well, definitely some part of it, as I opened up InterviewBit on a random day and headed to the contest section to find the upcoming hiring contest. But as Hitesh pointed out, if you think that it is luck, you might be missing out on the multiple opportunities that you've lost just because you didn't open their websites. Matter of fact, I did lose one opportunity though, Microsoft conducts an offline hiring contest around November/December by the name **Tech-Set-Go**. I became aware of this fact only recently. I guess the saying is correct, whenever one door closes another one always opens. Take the example of Sarthak, he waited so long for the internship but finally he was the only student selected for **Schlumburger**. The wait was definitely worth it.

Coming on to the technical details, I've already shared the questions of 2 rounds. (It was supposed to be a 3 round process, I don't know why they sent me the offer letter after just 2 rounds). The first round had 7 questions and I solved all of them (with minimal penalties). I guess that was a major influencing factor in my results. In the second round, I just solved 1.5 out of 3 questions (Brute force rocks!). Solving the 2nd question via brute force and the string library was one of the best decisions of my life. 

You know where the questions are!

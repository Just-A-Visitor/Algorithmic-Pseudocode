It's difficult to describe the multitude of emotions in a few sentences. I couldn't sleep well before the interview. I was up till up 4 in the morning, looking up past **Internship Experiences**. (Funnily enough, I skimmed through the interview questions in a hurry and spent a major time looking at the work culture). Amazon intrigued me!


The interview went really good. I was expecting a couple of more rounds but they had announced in the beginning that they won't be taking multiple rounds and would judge the candidates on the basis of the tests and interview. The interviewer was quite supportive. He tried to understand my approach for each problem and build upon it rather than expecting me to reach his solution. Well, **Goldman Sachs** and **Sprinklr** was a disaster in this respect. 

I don't want to share the questions but rest assured that they were standard questions and you'd breeze past them if you know the general techniques. Funnily enough, I somehow knew that the interviewer was asking questions from **GFG**, but I kept giving him `out of the box` answers from Leetcode's Discuss. (A 3 liner covering all cases instead of several corner-case analysis, and an O(n) solution instead of the expected O(n * log(n)) ). Well, I did improvise on the follow-up question though! The interviewer was quite impressed (at least that's what I felt!). 

I have several of my friends to thank for this achievement. On the surface, it might not look like a great accomplishment, but it boosts my confidence seeing how far I've come. Seriously, we under-estimate our potential. Had not it been for one of my friends, I'd still be working at Samsung, being complacent and unable to take risks. Not that Samsung was bad, it's just that I deserved better. Plus, it's always exciting to try out new things. 


I certainly didn't have Amazon in mind when I left Samsung. Microsoft and Flipkart were my only target. I was so close to getting into Microsoft. But close is not enough. A year back, I couldn't even dream of taking such a big risk for Microsoft. But things change, you need to keep moving forward. People recognize you only after your success. Had I been selected for Microsoft that day, what would've changed? Nothing. Had I not been selected for Amazon, what would've changed? Absolutely nothing. I would have still been the same person. It's just that people's perception about you change by seeing your achievements. And Flipkart, how did I miss Flipkart? I'm still in denial. Well, sometimes, we have to acknowledge that we are not the best and can be easily replaced. Maybe my preparation level wasn't up to the mark. Maybe I should focus more on writing code on paper rather than cursing my fate.

Let's hope that the internship is as exciting as it seems to be!

Remember the date, **24th August 2019**!

                Phase 2
# Phase 2 Tips   
* Practice writing code on paper.
* Your first submission should be your last submission. 
* Your first implementation on IDE should avoid compilation errors.
* Devote minimum 1 hour to each question.
* Start coding on IDE only after you have a batch of 10 pseudocodes.
* Don't think while coding on IDE. Just copy everything written on your paper.

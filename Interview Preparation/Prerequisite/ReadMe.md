# Foreword
* This list contains around 60 questions. Try to solve each question without looking at the solution. 
* Every question is a collapsible link. Upon expanding it, you can find the link to the online judge where you can submit it. I've also included the links to the solution, editorial (and hints at times).
* Try to solve each question using the paradigms of C++. It is but natural that you get stuck during the initial phase of problem solving. So, should you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask your doubts on Slack/Mail. In the meanwhile, move on to the next question. (The topics need not be attempted linearly).
* To study DP, you can go through the DP chapter from CLRS.
* However, a better alternative would be to lookup online videos for each problem. Some good channels are **BackToBackSWE**, **Tushar Roy** and **Abdul Bari**. 
* Once you've solved a particular question, go through all the top voted solutions on **Leetcode's Discuss**. This is the most crucial part of problem solving. Not only should you know the solution, but also various approaches for the same problem.
* If you feel confident enough, try participating in **Leetcode's Weekly and BiWeekly** Contests. This would give you a rough understanding of your current level of preparation.
* If and when you manage to complete this list, let me know and I'll update the next set of questions.

### Phase  : Linked List

<details>
	<summary>Reverse a Linked List</summary>

* [Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)   
* First try to solve the recursive version, then attempt the iterative version.   
* Make sure that the time complexity of the recursive version is **O(n)** rather than **O(n^2)**. This is very crucial
* [Analysis](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/discuss/254618/C%2B%2BJavaScript-Detailed-Explanation-Recursive-and-Iterative)   

</details>


<details>
	<summary>Intersection of 2 Linked List</summary>

* [Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)   
* One approach is to calculate the length, and then traverse the bigger list until the lengths becomes equal. Then traverse them parallelly until you find the intersection point.   
* The other solution uses a HashMap. (Should you hash pointers or the data?)   
* [Length Based Solution](https://github.com/Just-A-Visitor/Algorithmic-Pseudocode/blob/master/LeetCode%20Non-Contest%20Solutions/%23160%20Intersection%20of%202%20Linked%20Lists/Difference%20in%20Length%20Approach.cpp)

<details>
    <summary>Loop Detection in Linked List</summary>

* [Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
* One approach is to use **Slow and Fast Pointers**
* The second approach is to use **Hashing** (Should you Hash Pointers or Data?)
* [Slow and Fast Pointers Solution](https://github.com/Just-A-Visitor/Algorithmic-Pseudocode/blob/master/LeetCode%20Non-Contest%20Solutions/%23141%20Loop%20Detection%20in%20Linked%20List/Walker%20%26%20Runner%20Approach.cpp)
* Try to code the Hashing based approach by yourself. (It's very trivial)
* There's a more elegant approach to this question (which destroys the original list). It uses the concept of iterative reversal of a linked list. Can you come up with that approach.
* [Iterative Reversal Approrach](https://github.com/Just-A-Visitor/Algorithmic-Pseudocode/blob/master/LeetCode%20Non-Contest%20Solutions/%23141%20Loop%20Detection%20in%20Linked%20List/Reversal%20Approach.cpp)

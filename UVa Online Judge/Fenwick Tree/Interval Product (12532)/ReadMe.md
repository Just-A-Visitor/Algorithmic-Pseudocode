## Review
* Not a code that I'm proud of. It contains a lot of `if-else`. There's ought to be a cleaner approach.
* Interesting Application of BIT
* Maintain 2 parallel BIT (To store the count of positive and negative in any range)
* Time Taken ==> 12 minutes for coding, 8 minutes for debugging
* Penalty ==> None

## To Do
* Clean up the code. 
* Write an extended descriptioin

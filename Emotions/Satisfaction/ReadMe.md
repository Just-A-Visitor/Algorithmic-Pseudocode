### This is the most important chapter of my life.

        When you go to bed, you should be satisfied that you did your best today.

What do you think matters the most in life? Well, it varies from person to person. But for me, it's satisfaction.   

I cracked **JEE** and I'm studying in an IIT. So, am I satisfied? Absolutely not. I feel that the hardwork done by me during JEE preparation is not at par with Kota students. I hear all these tales about Kota and I get so excited. This is the same vibe I used to get during my JEE days. If only there was a way to go back in time and relive those moments! I have immense respect for Kota students. They will remain at the top of my priority list (atleast for 2 more years). How can one can be so passionate about studies? How can one study for 15-16 hours a day? I want to achieve that level of dedication and commitment. I want to level up with most hardworking student in Kota. This might not improve my grades. On the contrary, it might rather end up destroying my social life, friend circle, personality, etc. But that's fine I guess, It's not like I have a charming personality, why even bother about losing it? About friends, I can always manage them if I stop wasting time on useless stuffs. 

        JEE! Surely the destination has changed but the journey remains the same.
   
   
Maybe I'm still stuck in the past and need to move on. But my heart says that if I give up on this dream, I won't be able to sleep in peace for the rest of my life. Let's give it a shot!

It's been a long time since I've given a contest on LeetCode. I was only able to solve the 4th question (without any penalties, at the 58th minute). 

After going through the top submissions, I realized that the first question was very easy and I had misunderstood the question.   
I didn't even think through the remaining 2 questions. That's a task I need to accomplish in a day or two.

**Comments** 

* Accidentally saw the hints for Q3 (which uses binary search on answer). Didn't feel motivated to code it at that time as the implementation wasn't neat. I hope to solve it later in a neat way.

* After the contest, I saw the hints for Q4 (which was very easy). I'll try it later today,

# Review
This was the first weekly contest where I solved all the four questions, and that too with 30 minutes remaining. The questions were quite conceptual (and a bit easy I guess). Overall, I enjoyed the contest very much. One thing I particularly lacked was the speed and smoothness in touch typing. I really need to work on my keystrokes while writing code.

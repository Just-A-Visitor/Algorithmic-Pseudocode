# Review
This was the first weekly contest where I solved all the four questions, and that too with 30 minutes remaining. The questions were quite conceptual (and a bit easy I guess). Overall, I enjoyed the contest very much.

* Rank --- 301/6058
* Submission Times --- [6, 19, 36, 59]th minute respecively
* Penalty --- None

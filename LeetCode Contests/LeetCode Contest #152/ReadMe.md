### Strategy
* Devote the first 10 minutes for the first question
* The next 20 minutes for the second question
* The next 30 minutes for the fourth question 
* The last 30 minutes for the third question
* Start the coding phase only after you are sure of the correctnes.


## Aftermath
This was a really really good contest. Not in terms of the questions, but in terms of the adrelanine rush it created! I finished coding the fourth question 3-5 minutes after the contest, and it passed in one go. And, that was labelled `hard`. Moreover, this is the first time I've solved all the 4 questions without seeing any hint, editorial or solution. During the first hour of the contest, I stuck to my strategy. However, for the last 30 minutes, I decided to continue thinking on the 4th question, as I thought that the third one involves a lot of new tricks. However, after the contest, I implemented the third question in under 10 minutes. That was so easy.    
Moreover, I used a Trie Based Approach, which only a few people had used. So yeah, I felt pretty great on being able to apply Trie for the first time in my life. I took a penalty on the second question as I had misunderstood the question.    
Why didn't I think of the Bitwise approach for the fourth question?


**Overall, it was a great contest**.

**Submission Time**

Q1) 4 minutes   
Q2) 37 minutes   
Q3) ----   
Q4) 26 minutes   

This is the fastest time in which I have solved the 4th question. I solved 3 questions (except the second last one) in under 37 minutes. The second last one was also easy (Plain dfs implementation on matrix). But, I was feeling too sleepy and lazy!


# To Do
Solve the third question (#1219 -- Maximum Gold in a Path). It's a simple DFS.

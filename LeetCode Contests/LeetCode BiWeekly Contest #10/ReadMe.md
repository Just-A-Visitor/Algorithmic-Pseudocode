**Review**    
All the questions were amazing (especially the last one)


Upon further analysis, I didn't realize that in the second question, the 2 trees were BST. I solved it assuming normal trees (by converting to hash map). Although the complexity remains linear, it's not such a good solution.

Similarly for the first question, I kept doing some mistake in the implementation and ended up using maps. The intended solution was O(n). I didn't really use the fact that the arrays were sorted. This was also not upto the spirit of the question.

But, to compensate, I did do the remaining 2 solutions in an elegant manner.

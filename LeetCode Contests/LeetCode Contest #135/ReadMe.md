I have mixed feelings about this contest. It's been a while since I gave my last contest.   
Here are the statistics

* **Questions Solved** ==> 2 out of 4 [Q1, Q2]
* **Submission Time** ===> Q1) 31 Minutes, Q2) 18 Minutes
* **Rank** ===> 858/3636

The contest was indeed a tough one. Even **Votrubac** solved only the first 2 questions (which was quite shocking, as he gets every question in each contest, with a clean code). 

I haven't upsolved the remaining questions. **I'm too lazy**. My solutions for the first 2 questions weren't upto the mark, so I avoided posting on **Discuss**.

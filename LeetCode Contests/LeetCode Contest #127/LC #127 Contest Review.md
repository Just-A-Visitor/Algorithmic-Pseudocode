**Remarks** ----- I have mixed feelings about this contest. I managed to solve 3 out of 4 questions yet I'm not satisfied with my performance.
I ended up doing a lot of incorrect submissions. My accuracy in this contest was way off the mark. Moreover, I didn't write quality codes in 
any of the questions. I didn't even realize that the time complexity of the 4th question is O(n^2). I ended up taking down that post and my other 
solutions received bad reviews too. I need to focus more on writing quality codes with optimal complexity along with a thorough explanation. This
would benefit me more than anyone else, as it would be a great help during my revision. I was going through the solution of the top 10 people 
in the contest and I was literally amazed by the elegance of their solution. Now I realize why are they able to complete the contest within 10
to 15 minutes. **I have to see the codes of atleast top 10 people from the next contest**.

**LC#129 Contest Review**

**Thoughts**

* I've been under-performing for the past few contests. I need to be more focused during the contests (Last contest, I lost motivation just after half an hour).
* **Is tomorrow's contest going to be the one where I solve all  the questions during the contest duration**? Well, that's not in my control. However, I can ensure that I solve all the questions by myself latest by 11AM.

**Schedule**
* 8-9:30  -> Contest
* 9:30-10 -> Breakfast
* 10-11   -> Implement the unsolved questions
* 11-12   -> Write blogs, read Top contestant's code, read **Discuss** articles.

**Strategy**
* I've decided to experiment a bit with my strategy during tomorrow's contest. In the first 5 minutes, I won't implement anything. Instead I'll devote the time to read each of the 4 questions.

The contest was pre-poned by 1 hour and I was not aware of that. Eventually I didn't solve any of the question during contest duration. 
I upsolved all the questions afterwards.

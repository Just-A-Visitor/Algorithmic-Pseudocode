## Strategy 
* **Phase 1** ==> First 45 minutes for the fourth question
* **Phase 2** ==> Next 45 minutes for the third question 
* **Phase 3** ==> The remaining 30 minutes for the first and second question.
* **Phase 4** ==> A virtual contest of 2 hours for the 5th and 6th question.

Start coding only after you're certain of the correctness of the algorithm. There's no going back once you start typing. Don't give in to greedy this time! And most importantly, write code on paper first before coding. Your writing speed is way slower than your typing speed, and hence you are bound to make less errors. Thanks (??) for this suggestion!

## Aftermath
This was not a bad contest overall. Yes, I did a lot of silly mistakes, messed up the strategy, but in the end, I solved the 4th qeustion. (There was a total of 6). I started coding at the 55th minute, and made the submission after 1 hour and 13 minutes. This accounts for 75 minutes for the 4th question (I had planned on 45!). As per the strategy, I attempted the third question for the remaining 15 minutes but could not come up with a strategy (I was nowhere close). At the 90th minute, I abandoned the 3rd question and moved on to the first question. It seemed kinda tricky and hence after spending 5 to 7 minutes, I decided to move  onto the 2nd question. However, I couldn't concentrate and hence couldn't come up with the logic. With around 10-15 minutes remaining, I decided to start coding the first question. Made the implementation very dirty, with lots of corner cases, expecting it to pass. I submitted around 5 minutes remaining, and sadly, it failed the 3rd test case. Well, it had to, that was just a shot in the dark. 


So, to conclude, I didn't look at the 5th and 6th question, solved the 4th question correctly, and have absolutely no idea how to solve the first 3! The 5th one is on segment trees, so I'd have to learn it first to upsolve it. However, I would give a virtual contest covering the first 3 questions.

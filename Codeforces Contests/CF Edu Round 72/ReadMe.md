## Strategy 
* **Phase 1** ==> First 45 minutes for the fourth question
* **Phase 2** ==> Next 45 minutes for the third question 
* **Phase 3** ==> The remaining 30 minutes for the first and second question.
* **Phase 4** ==> A virtual contest of 2 hours for the 5th and 6th question.

Start coding only after you're certain of the correctness of the algorithm. There's no going back once you start typing. Don't give in to greedy this time! And most importantly, write code on paper first before coding. Your writing speed is way slower than your typing speed, and hence you are bound to make less errors. Thanks (??) for this suggestion!

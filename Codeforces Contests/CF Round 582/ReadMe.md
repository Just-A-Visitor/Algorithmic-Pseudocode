### Strategy Before the Contest
I have decided to experiment a little. I would start the contest from the 4th question onwards.   
* 45 minutes for the 4th problem   
* 45 minutes for the 5th problem.  
* If I do both (or just 5th) before the alloted time, I would move onto the 6th question.
* If not, I will start solving the first 3 questions in the last 30 minutes.   

This is a divison 3 round. The last 3 questons would be easily solvable. I have to struggle till the last minute.

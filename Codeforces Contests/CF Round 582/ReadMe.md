### Strategy Before the Contest
I have decided to experiment a little. I would start the contest from the 4th question onwards.   
* 45 minutes for the 4th problem   
* 45 minutes for the 5th problem.  
* If I do both (or just 5th) before the alloted time, I would move onto the 6th question.
* If not, I will start solving the first 3 questions in the last 30 minutes.   

This is a divison 3 round. The last 3 questons would be easily solvable. I have to struggle till the last minute.

## Aftermath
This contest was a disaster. The questions were mostlly observation based and implementation heavy (unless you know the correct shorter way). I solved the first question in the last 10 minutes (which was perfectly valid) and later submitted another solution handling the case when `n == 1`. Sadlly the first solution was correct, the second was not. Silly me!

The only question worth upsolving is the last question (which uses **DSU**).


**I am not giving Divison 3 Contests again**.

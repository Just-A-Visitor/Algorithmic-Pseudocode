# Introduction
This repository contains the pseudo-code of various algorithms and data structures necessary for **Interview Preparation** and **Competitive Coding**

# Contribution
Read this section carefully if you are planning on contributing to this repository. 

**The What**

* In the `Pseudocode` folder, you can find a lot of algorithms. If you've come across any interesting algorithm that changed the way you think about any topic, please consider contributing it to this repo.

* There are a lot of pseudocodes with no explanation. If you want to write the a detailed explanation on the working and intuition of these algorithms, please raise an issue and start working on it after it is approved). I would prefere if the explanation in `pdf` format. However, markdown format is equally acceptable.


* If you want to contribute anything other pseudocodes, feel free to explore the repository and pick up a code and explain its logic and working (either in `pdf` or `Markdown` format).  If you don't see your desired code, feel free to add it. However, remember that this repository is not a code dump and you should only add new codes if you have written a good post explaining the intricacies of the algorithm.

**The Why**

* You'll understand the algorithm in depth once you start working on it's pseudocode because now you need to explain your code to people who code in a variety of language. 

* You work might help other people preparing for interviews/competitive programming get acquainted with the core concepts of the algorithms rather than being confused by the clutter of the programming language.

* Lastly, you'll get to learn **Latex** which is a great experience in itself. 

**The How**

* If this is your first time contributing to a public repository, please refer this [link](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/)

* If you are not familiar with **TEX** or TypeSetting in general, please refer this [link]([https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)). You don't need to install anything to contribute to this repository. Just make sure that you have an **Overleaf** account and you are good to go.

* Create an _issue_ if you've decided to work on an algorithm and get it approved before the coding phase.

* Make sure to follow the coding standards. Put all the headers related to the the specific package in a separate file called `macros.tex`.  Put the source code in a file called `SourceCode.tex`. (Notice the Capitalisation).

* If you want to code a different implementation than what is already present (for example, _iterative_ instead of _recursive_, constant space instead of linear space, etc), please create a new sub-folder inside the root directory.

* Don't include a lot of comments in the pseudocode (it just means that the code is not self-expressive). However, if the algorithm is highly non-trivial and you would like to include some explanation, please do so before or after the pseudocode. Refer this [link]() for example. 

* Please include a `ReadMe.md` file in each of the folder that you create. It can either contain the details about your algorithm or you can leave it empty (so that others can edit it eventually).

* If you borrow the code from any online / offline source, please remember to cite it.

* Finally, please include a `pdf` file of the final source code in the correspoding folder.

* Make a pull request. Sit back and relax while your pull request gets merged.
